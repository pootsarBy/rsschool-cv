            <p>
              During my studies I had several coursework and two diploma
              projects. All work was performed in different programming
              languages, depending on the requirements. The latest development
              was the diploma project made for the Department of educational
              systems design of the Republican Institute of higher
              education.This software tool is used to test soft skills of
              students. I don't have any experience in production.
